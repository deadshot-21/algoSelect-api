Questions,What level of security do you require? Are there any known vulnerabilities you need to avoid?,How quickly do you need the algorithm to encrypt and decrypt data? Is speed a crucial factor for your use case?,"Do you have the resources and expertise to implement complex algorithms, or do you need something that is easy to implement?",What is your specific use case? Some algorithms are better suited for certain applications than others.,"Do you need an algorithm that can be adapted for different uses and applications, or do you have a specific use case in mind?","Will the amount of data you need to encrypt increase over time? If so, how well does the algorithm scale with increasing data size?","How secure do you need the encryption to be? Larger keys generally provide more security, but they can also slow down the algorithm.",What is the size of the data blocks that you will be working with? Does your data naturally fit into a certain block size?,Are there specific types of attacks you are concerned about? Different algorithms have different vulnerabilities.
